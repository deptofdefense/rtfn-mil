313.6(C)(1) U.S. Government Works<br>
Copyright protection under the Copyright Act is not available for “any work of the United States<br>
Government,” regardless of whether it is published or unpublished. 17 U.S.C. § 105; see also H.R.<br>
Rep. No. 94-1476, at 58 (1976), reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5672. This includes legislation<br>
enacted by Congress, decisions issued by the federal judiciary, regulations issued by a federal<br>
agency, or any other work prepared by an officer or employee of the U.S. federal government<br>
while acting within the course of his or her official duties. It also includes works prepared by<br>
an officer or employee of the government of the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of<br>
Puerto Rico, or the organized territories under the jurisdiction of the federal government.<br>
If an applicant states that the U.S. government or any of its agencies, officers, or employees<br>
created the work while acting within the scope of their employment, the registration specialist<br>
may communicate with the applicant and may refuse registration, even if the claimant is a<br>
nongovernmental entity.<br>
There are several exceptions to these rules:<br>
• Although works prepared by officers or employees of the U.S. government within the scope<br>
of their employment are not copyrightable, the federal government may receive and hold<br>
“copyrights transferred to it by assignment, bequest, or otherwise.” 17 U.S.C. § 105. For example,<br>
a U.S. government agency may register a website created by a government contractor,<br>
provided that the contractor did not create the website for the agency as a work made for<br>
hire and provided that the contractor transferred the copyright in that work to that agency. <br>

• A work prepared by an officer or employee of the U.S. government may be registered if the<br>
